## Run

Each day can be run by executing the included python script. 

Example for day1

```
python3.8 day1.py <input_file>
```

As output you will get the solutions to both part one and two. 

### Python-Version

I used `python3.8` for all days so it should work with either this or any higher version unless no backwards compatability is provided.
